      header = div + role
      HW1: review header, section, footer, nav, aside,  figure

      HEADER: 
      is an element that represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.

      SECTION: is a generic sectioning element, and should only be used if there isn't a more specific element to represent it. As an example, a navigation menu should be wrapped in a <nav> element, but a list of search results or a map display and its controls don't have specific elements, and could be put inside a <section>.

      FOOTER:
      typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents. (Elementul <footer> nu secționează conținutul și, prin urmare, nu introduce o nouă secțiune în schiță.)

      NAV :
      represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.

      ASIDE:
      represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's
      main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.

      FIGURE: 
      represents self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, which is specified
      using the <figcaption> element. The figure, its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit. 
      Usually a <figure> is an image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc., that is referenced in the main flow of a document, but that can be moved to another part of the document or to an appendix without affecting the main flow.
